      <p>
      	The Program identified the natural, technological, human-caused, and hazardous material hazards in the following documents: CCD Hazard Analysis worksheet and 2010 Denver Region Hazard Mitigation Plan, Risk Assessment, Pgs. 24-74.</p>
      <p>
      	Natural hazards identified in both the Hazard Analysis and Hazard Mitigation Plan includes: &nbsp;Drought, Earthquake, Flood, Temperature Extremes/Heat wave, Landslide, Ice Storm/Winter Storm/freezing, Severe Thunderstorm (lightening), Tornado, Wildland fire. Additional natural hazards identified in the CDC Hazard Analysis include: &nbsp;Blizzard, Dam inundation, Hurricane, Snow fall, Tidal wave, Volcano, Epidemic. Additional natural hazards identified in the Hazard Mitigation Plan include: &nbsp;Avalanche, Hail, Land subsidence.</p>
      <p>
      	Human-caused hazards identified in the CDC Hazard Analysis include three groupings:&nbsp; Human caused: &nbsp;Mass casualty (trauma), Mass casualty incident (medical/infectious), Terrorism-Biological, VIP situation, Infant abduction; Technological: &nbsp;Electrical failure, Generator failure, Transportation failure, Fuel shortage, Natural gas failure, Water failure, Sewer failure, Steam failure, Fire alarm failure, Communications failure, Medical gas failure, Medical vacuum failure, HVAC failure, Information systems failure, Fire, Hazmat exposure, Supply shortage, Structural damage; Hazardous Materials:&nbsp; Mass casualty hazmat, Small casualty hazmat, Chemical exposure, Small-medium sized spills, Large spills/releases, Terrorism-Chemical, Radiologic release, Radiologic exposure, Terrorism-Radiologic.</p>
      <p>
      	Per an interview, the Program&rsquo;s hazards are the hazards in the Hazard Analysis, but there is inconsistency in the hazards identified in the Hazard Analysis and Hazard Mitigation Plan. The Program did not document the broad range the sources for the Hazard Analysis. In Hazard Mitigation Plan, the Risk Assessment Section (Pgs. 24-74) and Appendix A (Pgs. A 1-45) does provide documentation of sources used for the natural hazards; however the risk assessment does not provide a hazard analysis of human-caused hazards.</p>
      <p>
      	The Program assessed the risk and vulnerability to people, property, and entity itself in the following documents: &nbsp;CCD Hazard Analysis worksheet and 2010 Denver Region Hazard Mitigation Plan, Risk Assessment, Pgs. 24-74. The Program did not provide a risk and vulnerability for the environment.</p>

      	&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Risk Assessments that provide the factual basis for activities proposed in the strategy portion of the mitigation plan. Statewide risk assessments must characterize and analyze natural hazards and risks to provide a statewide overview. This overview will allow the State to compare potential losses throughout the State and to determine their priorities for implementing mitigation measures under the strategy, and to prioritize jurisdictions for receiving technical and financial support in developing more detailed local risk and vulnerability assessments. The risk assessment shall include the following:&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	[i]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An overview of the type and location of all natural hazards that can affect the State, including information on previous occurrences of hazard events, as well as the probability of future hazard events, using maps where appropriate.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	[ii]&nbsp;&nbsp; An overview and analysis of the State&rsquo;s vulnerability to the hazards described in paragraph (c) (2), based on estimates provided in local risk assessments as well as the State risk assessment. The State shall describe vulnerability in terms of jurisdictions most threatened by the identified hazards, and most vulnerable to damage and loss associated with hazard events. State owned critical or operated facilities located in the identified hazard areas shall also be addressed.</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	[iii]&nbsp; An overview and analysis of potential losses to the identified vulnerable structures, based on estimates provided in local risk assessments as well as the State risk assessment. The State shall estimate the potential dollar losses to State owned or operated buildings, infrastructure and critical facilities located in the identified hazard areas.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	In the context of hazard mitigation planning &ldquo;risk&rdquo; is defined as the expected future losses to a community, business or State from the effects of natural events combining the probability, severity, and vulnerability. Risk is often expressed in terms of future monetary losses because this provides a common measure that can be used to compare the effects of different hazards. &nbsp;It is important to note that risk is cumulative. &nbsp;This means that although natural hazards may not affect a place in any particular year, the probability of one or more events (in some places multiple events) occurring &ldquo;adds up&rdquo; over time. Risk calculations incorporate possible future events over a specific period. Capturing a long period allows repetitive events to be included in the risk calculation. In many cases data is <em>annualized </em>to express the chance of a hazard occurring each year.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Probability:&nbsp; </strong>Probability is the likelihood that a hazard will impact a particular place. The ability of scientists and engineers to calculate probability varies considerably depending on the hazard in question. In many areas of the country,&nbsp;flood studies provide reasonably accurate estimates of how often water will reach particular places and elevations. On the other hand, tornados and earthquakes are nearly impossible to predict, except over very long periods of time and large areas.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Severity:&nbsp; </strong>Severity is the measure of &ldquo;how bad&rdquo; a hazard event is. Severity is measured in various ways, depending on the hazard. For example, floods are measured in terms of depth, velocity, duration, contamination potential, debris flow, and so forth. Tornados are measured primarily in terms of wind speed, although their duration on the ground can also be an important factor in their destructiveness.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Vulnerability:&nbsp; </strong>Vulnerability is the degree to which something is damaged by a hazard.&nbsp; These are based on studies of how buildings perform when they are exposed to hazards. Similar functions are available for infrastructure and other physical assets. Injury and mortality functions (how many people are injured or die during events) are also sometimes used as indicators of vulnerability, but these are generally not as reliable as functions for physical assets because there are many more variables.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 33pt;">
      	<strong>Value:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Value is how much it would cost to replace an asset that may be damaged or lost due to the impact of a natural hazard. &nbsp;Damage refers to physical destruction measured by physical indicators such as the number of deaths and injuries or the portions of buildings destroyed, or altered so that repair is needed. When valued in monetary terms, damages become direct losses&nbsp; There are many sources of this information, including standard cost-estimating guides (such as R.S. Means, which was used as the basis for the hurricane wind risk assessment), experience of local officials, the FEMA HAZUS (Hazards U.S.) software.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Risk calculations often start with an annualized (yearly) loss figure, which is then projected into the future for some pre-determined period (sometimes called the <em>planning horizon</em>), then <em>discounted </em>to today&rsquo;s value using a discount rate. Discounting is a standard economic methodology that is required by the Federal government for analyses of many of its programs, including FEMA&rsquo;s mitigation initiatives. It is used to account for the decreasing monetary value of events that occur far in the future, such as natural hazards. Those who are interested can read more about the required methodology as described in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-94.</p>
      <p>
      	The risk calculation techniques that were used as the basis for this plan are carefully described in the sections that follow, and conform to standard methodologies used by &nbsp;FEMA and other Federal agencies.&nbsp; As required by OMB, a discount rate of 7 percent is used in all calculations unless otherwise specified.&nbsp;</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 71.5pt;">
      	<strong>Section 4.3&nbsp; Methodology for Identifying Statewide Hazards of Concern</strong></p>
      <p>
      	In accordance with the requirements of the Interim Final Rule (Specific reference in 4.1.1 and full copy included in Appendix B) requires that all hazards with the potential to affect New Jerseyare profiled in this section of the Plan. However, because this is a State-level hazard mitigation plan it is useful to identify the hazards that are of the most concern Statewide, so these can be the focus of more detailed assessment. It is important to note, however, that many hazards and risks are very site-specific, so as regional and local jurisdictions develop mitigation plans they should recognize that this process and the resulting table should be used only as a guide, and that more detailed and localized vulnerability and risk assessments are required for local mitigation plans.</p>

    - Integrate private sector partners into planning process as early as possible. Private sector integration should be added to the Denver Emergency Operations Plan (EOP), so it becomes a normal part of all activations.

      <p>
      	Planners vs. Operators: As the planning process evolved, it became clear that not all of the individuals involved in the planning process would be directly involved in DNC operations. Conversely, some individuals that were tapped to be part of Branch operations during the DNC did not have a significant role in the planning process. As a result, not all of the operations staff were as familiar with the plans as they could have been</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Make every effort to ensure that the people participating in the planning process will also be key operational players during the event. Ensure that all operational personnel are fully briefed on planning that has been conducted.</p>

      <p>
      	Large-Scale Planning: Much of the consequence management planning was oriented toward a major large-scale event. Some of this planning was not easily scalable to the small-scale events we actually experienced during the DNC.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Plan for both small and large-scale events, and ensure that all plans can expand and contract seamlessly to match the needs of the incident.</p>

      <p>
      	Requesting Federal Resources: During the planning process, it was not always clear which entity was responsible for requesting assistance from Federal and state resources, such as National Guard assets, Health and Human Services teams, Department of Defense assets etc. By the start of the convention, this had largely been cleared up, but it caused some confusion early on.</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;Recommendation: Make every effort to train and reinforce the planning and resource-ordering framework so that stakeholders are aware of procedures that are needed to fill their requests. Establish a reserve budget within the City&rsquo;s coffers, or work with Federal government to facilitate an earlier grant award in the planning process.</p>

      <p>
      	Equipment Purchases: Though the planning process provided for identification of equipment needs, the project funding process left insufficient lead time for purchasing of significant capital equipment and to address the complexity of requirements for tracking of these assets.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Clearly identify the process for requesting state and Federal resources early on in the planning process.</p>

      	Federal Asset Information Sharing: Some Federal agencies, such as the Biowatch program, were unable to share information (new sensor placement, locations, information) with responsible state and local agencies.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Insist on sharing of information from Federal partners on updated or modified surveillance systems.</p>

      <p>
      	Life-safety evaluation: The DNCC did not allow DFD to conduct a life-safety evaluation of the DNC venues. A life-safety evaluation was conducted by the DNCC, but was not made available to DFD until one week prior to the start of the DNC. There was too much negotiation in the areas of occupant loading, and the process to verify occupancy numbers and overcrowding did not meet DFD requirements.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: The Fire Department must insist upon and institute its own life-safety evaluation during the planning process. This would enable proper development of counting procedures and establish DFD as the sole authority on crowd numbers. In the planning stages, crowd control from a Fire Code standpoint must be emphasized and not negotiated.</p>

      <p>
      	Permitting: Incorporated into the City&rsquo;s planning process for the DNC was the assembling of a single team consisting of representatives of agencies that issued permits necessary for the DNC. While the concept seemed fine, it proved difficult to get all agency representatives together at the same time. Permits that involved a single agency were delayed, and the person designated to receive the permit requests (background information, site plan[s], construction specifications, etc.) was not always available. This resulted in a backlog in approved permits.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Leave the permit process with each respective agency, and place definitive turnaround times with a reporting system with central oversight. Provide Liaisons between permit-issuers and event planners.</p>

      	Service Personnel Access To Secure Locations: Service personnel and equipment access to secure areas was slow and troublesome.</p>

      <p>
      	Late Delivery Of Equipment: As with many other resources (See Section 11), some did not allow enough lead time in ordering equipment to ensure timely delivery from manufacturer.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: As discussed in more detail in Section 11, communications resources and other equipment must be ordered early enough to ensure early delivery, allowing for receipt, programming, and user training.</p>

      <p>
      	WebEOC Protocols: OEM implemented WebEOC over a six-month period prior to the DNC. With all the other planning activities going on, this proved to be insufficient lead time to fully train all users and develop a level of familiarity with the program. While most users reported finding WebEOC easy to use from a technical standpoint, some users were less clear on the procedural side of what type of information should be entered, how entries should be formatted, etc. Respondents who had attended a WebEOC training class in generally responded more favorably than those who had not.</p>

      	Recommendation: More detailed written procedures and user guidelines for WebEOC are needed. (This need was identified prior to the DNC, but was not completed prior to activation.) Future program implementations should be given more lead time prior to major events.</p>

      	Access To City Intranet: DFD command staff in the field were unable to access the City&rsquo;s intranet. Some of the tools available through the intranet would have made a more complete information and would have been nice resource to use during some decision making process. Some of these tools are traffic cameras, HRB information, staffing for the shift, access to high speed printers and documents stored on the City&rsquo;s server. The computer used by the DFD planning section was setup with a VPN using a Verizon air card. The information transfer was extremely slow was not practical to use.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Setup a minimum of two computers with VPN and high speed internet access. The computers used by Command and Plans need to be modern and need to be able support access to the City Intranet. Command and Plans also need to have access to printers and copiers that can support the work load. Tech Services works with TSS to identify 2 laptops and get access to high speed printers. All necessary software and drivers should be installed and ready for use.</p>

      	Communications Problems In Security Room At Invesco Field: Following the move to INVESCO Field, Denver Health EMS command was unable to communicate outside the security room via radio due to significant structural interference. As a result, they had to relocate their operation to an area remote from Fire Department command staff, resulting in an inability to communicate face-to-face. (Fire Department Line Shop personnel were able to effectively overcome the radio interference for the radio system used by the Denver Fire Department.)</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Identify a responsible person, group, or agency to address communications issues with Denver Health.</p>

      	Incompatibility Between Different Information Sharing Systems: Several different information sharing and task management systems were used during the DNC, to include the USSS&rsquo; Incident Manager, WebEOC, SATool, CEPP&rsquo;s Business EOC, and Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD). For the most part, each of these tools worked well at what they were designed to do. However, the existence of several different parallel systems was sometimes confusing and duplicative.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: It may not be feasible to eliminate or combine some systems, as each tool was designed for different purposes and different groups of users. However, better coordination between the systems would help ensure they are working in concert, rather than in conflict.</p>

      	Traffic Camera Controls: Several different command centers had access to the City&rsquo;s traffic camera system. While this was invaluable for all centers, it led to some minor conflicts when different viewers wanted to move or zoom cameras</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: While some conflicts are probably inevitable with any shared resources, a clear written policy should be developed to negotiate priorities for camera control.</p>

      	Responder Feeding: Food and drink was provided free of charge to all responders working all of the DNC venues. The food was prepared and provided by volunteer organizations within the region. There was one distribution point at each of the venues; this distribution point was often several blocks away from the station members were assigned. However, there was some initial confusion as to whether the volunteer organization would be providing two meals per day, or two meals per 12-hour shift. Delivery times were sometimes erratic. Lastly, while the quality of most meals was acceptable, a few meals were less appetizing.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: As generous as it was of the volunteer organizations to offer this service for our responders, the City needs to ensure that the quality, quantity, and availability of these meals are clear. Before any contracts are signed, the food size and quality should be sampled. Delivery locations and schedules need to be clearly planned in advance.</p>

      <p>
      	Late Purchase Of Equipment: Due to uncertainties over when and if Federal funding would be approved, the City and County of Denver was initially unprepared to purchase much of the equipment and supplies needed to run an event of this magnitude. By the time Federal funding was awarded, and a funding mechanism was established, order windows were nearly past. The rush of last-minute ordering exceeded the manpower capabilities of some agencies, and also necessitated a scramble to find existing equipment that could be used if the new equipment did not arrive in time. Some equipment didn&rsquo;t arrive until a few days before the event, causing another rush to receive, inventory, and train with the new equipment.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Denver or any other city planning for future events of this magnitude should conduct a survey of existing equipment, and an assessment of what resources would be needed for the event, as soon as possible. The host city must make the commitment to properly fund needed equipment for the event up front; they cannot wait until the Federal Government makes up its mind as to when the funding or reimbursements will be released. Host cities must also take into consideration the normal processing delays associated with strict rules in their purchasing departments, and create exemptions to those rules where possible.</p>

      <p>
      	Receiving And Tracking Of Equipment: A significant amount of work is required to receive, inventory, process, track, and distribute major equipment items. The normal resources of many City agencies were overwhelmed by the last-minute receipt of all this equipment. For example, the DFD Repair Shop was designated as the single receiving point for all Fire equipment. One mechanic was designated as equipment custodian, and wound up doing the bulk of the workload by himself under extreme time pressure.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Designating a single receiving location is a sensible option, and City agencies should designate such a location for all new equipment purchases. However, enough personnel and resources must be made available to that location to ensure the work gets done in time.</p>

      	Delivery And Set-Up Of Equipment At The Venue: Due to security concerns some equipment was provided to the area but not set up by General Service&rsquo;s personnel.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: Ensure that technical personnel are credentialed to enter the venue(s) if they will be needed to set up equipment. Also consider staging pre-screened containers containing equipment such as generators, microphone and amp system and stage materials that can then be quickly provided to a secured facility.</p>

      	Too Many Different Types Of Credentials: The number and type of different credentials led to some confusion and much redundancy. For example, food inspectors needed a total of five different credentials to do their jobs: a DNC photo ID badge, pre-convention credentials for the Pepsi Center, pre-convention credentials for Invesco Field, convention credentials for the Pepsi Center, and convention credentials for Invesco Field. Additionally, there seemed to be some conflict between the DNCC and USSS on what credentials were required.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: The number and type of different credentials should be reduced and kept as simple as possible</div>

      	USSS Credentials Were Not Issued Far Enough Out: USSS did not issue their credentials until one week before the start of the convention. This did not allow adequate time to correct errors and omissions in those credentials.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: All credentials should be issued at least two weeks prior to the start of the event. Many problems could have been resolved well in advance by pre-screening photos and database information to ensure information is accurate and current.</div>

      <p>
      	Vehicle Access: The delay in getting member&rsquo;s vehicles through security proved to be one of the bigger obstacles everyday. Because parking was provided for responders within the security zone, each member had to drive a vehicle inside the security area. Although many responders car pooled, we still had at least 30 vehicles going through security screens at every crew change. With a minimal number of security check points open, the line of vehicles was a couple blocks long. This delay caused several crews to hold over for 30 minutes before a crew change could be made. Much of the difficulty was a result of lack of a sufficient number of parking passes for each Fire Department member working the event and miscommunication of the plan between USSS command staff and USSS members working various security posts.</p>
      <p>
      	Recommendation: All members employed or working the convention should park off site and be bussed in. If this is not feasible, the acquisition of a sufficient number parking&nbsp;passes/security credentials is imperative. USSS agents working the posts should be better versed in the operational plan. Finally, the planned operational period or work schedule needs to be extended to include 30 minutes before and after each operational period to effect crew change.</p>

      	EOC Credentialing: Credentialing for EOC staff was not completed in advance of the event, partly due to installation of a new card reader system. This resulted in some delays and confusion issuing credentials to non-City employees, as well as entering cleared City employees into the system database. Additionally, there was some confusion over gaining access to the City and County Building itself, which was closed to the public during the convention.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: EOC credentials should be issued to identified staff in advance of the event to minimize the demands for just-in-time credentialing.</div>

      <div>
      	More Venue-Specific Training Needed: Teams needed more specific training for their specialty assignments in the venues. This especially became apparent when the convention moved to INVESCO Field. Members with no or limited knowledge of the venue had uncertainty about breakout room locations and how well they would react if the worst case scenario occurred. Breakout rooms were small and uncomfortable and had limited or no access later in the week. Specialized equipment was not available for all the members on some specialty teams. The move to INVESCO was announced so late that planning, much less training, was extremely difficult.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Ideally, teams would be established several months prior to the event and the venue would allow several training exercises for the agencies that will be working in the venue. Training needs to be more than a review of standard operating practices and a one hour walk through of the venue. Budgeting for training should be a higher priority. Require that access is always granted to break out areas when needed to check equipment and when performing daily equipment checks. Provide reasonable and comfortable breakout rooms for the firefighters and equipment required by the NSSE and USSS.</div>

      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
      	Lack Of Consistency In Assignments: Members did not always work the same assignment when working multiple shifts at the venue, and specialty companies were not utilized in specialty roles at all times. For example, a Fire Department member was assigned to EMS one day and a De-con Strike Team the next shift at the DNC. If a person was assigned to one discipline for the whole event it would created more stability in the process. When allocating the staffing for these assignments it was decided to be as fair and equitable as possible in the distribution of the considerable amount of overtime. Members were asked to sign up for DNC overtime on a &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; basis only. Specialty team members advocated that fair and equitable should not play a role to specialty assignments.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Every effort was made to equitably distribute overtime hours and pay. This resulted in members getting varied assignments during the week of the convention. After the initial draft assignment roster was released, specialty team Captains were given the opportunity to adjust staffing to make sure team capability was not compromised. During off peak hours some &ldquo;specialty&rdquo; assignments were staffed with crews that made up more traditional Engine and Truck Companies due to the decreased threat during late night and early morning hours. Normal operations continued outside the NSSE site with day-to-day specialty companies fully staffed.</div>

      <p>
      	Reassignment Of FLSH Assets: Assigning interior Strike Teams and exterior crews to Fire Prevention and crowd control activities diminished emergency response capability. After day one of the DNC it was clear that crowd control would be a major issue for the&nbsp;week. With the equivalent of 11 response crews dedicated to the security zone some crews were assigned to provide crowd control monitoring and dispersal duties during the heaviest activity on the convention floor.</p>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Early planning scenarios involved this issue and options were discussed at length. It was important in the planning process to prevent &ldquo;two separate fire departments&rdquo;; one with the sole responsibility for response and the other for code enforcement. Response capability would be maintained when utilizing response companies for crowd control in extreme situations taking into consideration real time threat assessment factors and never dropping below an initial first alarm assignment within the Security Zone.</div>

      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: The EOC needs to be able to quickly secure its air supply in the event of a chemical release. Escape hood or similar equipment needs to be available for all EOC staff. Training, PPE and PPE fit-testing must be included in an overall plan for responding to a CBRNE incident in close proximity to the EOC.</div>

      	Pedestrian Lighting, Portable Toilets, and Water Stations: Lighting, portable toilets, and drinking water stations were set up outside key venues. However, the number were not sufficient for the event, and their locations were not always were they were most needed.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Pre-determine the routes pedestrians are most likely to use, and concentrate on those areas.</div>

      	Earlier Integration: CEPP was not brought into the EOC structure until shortly before the event. As valuable as they proved to be, they could&rsquo;ve been even more invaluable if they had been integrated into EOC operations and procedures earlier in the planning process, and included in training and exercises.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Integrate private sector partners into planning process as early as possible. Private sector integration should be added to the Denver EOP, so it becomes a normal part of all activations.</div>

      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Communicate with the private sector as early and as often as possible, so that their needs are addressed and their capabilities are identified.</div>

      	WebEOC: As discussed in Section 4 above, DOEM implemented WebEOC software to assist with EOC operations as well as information sharing between different command centers. DOEM conducted several training classes, training over 300 users on WebEOC. However, this proved to be only a fraction of the more than 700 people who used WebEOC during the convention. Additionally, changes to the program made on the fly, while helpful, created additional training challenges and were not always fully communicated to users.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: DOEM should plan to conduct Just In Time Training on WebEOC (and EOC operations in general) during any activation to ensure that all staff are fully trained. Any changes made to the program during an event must be clearly explained to all users.</div>

      	Training For Non-Venue Personnel: Despite attempts to provide training to all personnel that needed it, priority often went to individuals assigned to working at the venue locations. While this is understandable to a degree, it meant that personnel working outside the venues were not always on the same page as their counterparts inside the venues.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Wherever possible, training should be made available for all responders, not just those working inside the hard zone.</div>

      <div>
      	Security Of National Guard Elements: The National Guard Task Forces are not organized with stand alone security elements; this must either be provided by other National Guard forces or by civilian responders. The City of Denver and State of Colorado did not want uniformed, armed military personnel anywhere near the event. Security was a significant concern for unprotected military personnel operating adjacent to a major ingress and egress thoroughfare for protestors. The NG CER TF coordinated with Denver Police Department for perimeter security. This was then delegated to the Auraria Campus Police Department. Additionally, when concerns arose about a protest march of 4000+ persons, horse mounted officers from other supporting agencies reinforced the NG CER TF operational perimeter. Prior to occupation for the operational period, a barrier was installed around the CER TF perimeter, providing both visual and physical protection.</div>
      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Do not assume National Guard assets provide their own security. Include detailed security plans in the initial discussions. Try to stage potentially contentious military troops remote from public areas.</div>

      	EOC Security: Several interior security doors were regularly found propped open. This was largely due to credentialing difficulties.</p>

      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>

      	Dispatch Center Security: Denver County Court Marshals provided site security at both the MAD and the normal 911 Dispatch Call Center. For the most part, this arrangement worked well. However, the Marshals were sometimes unavailable at shift change times, thus requiring dispatch staff to take over responsibility for employee access.</div>
      <div>

      <div>
      	&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
      	Recommendation: Designate a parking location for motorcade vehicles to stage until their principal has landed and is ready for pick up. Ensure adequate uniformed officers are available at curbside to handle the increased traffic problems.</div>

      <p>
      	The 45th Democratic National Convention (DNC) was held in Denver, Colorado from August 25 to August 28, 2008. The DNC brought unprecedented worldwide attention to the City of Denver. An estimated 35,000 participants attended the convention, including 15,000 national and international media representatives. The DNC provided the stage from which thousands of individuals could voice their political views through mass gatherings, parades and protests.</p>
      <div>
      	The Pepsi Center served as the primary location for DNC events from August 25 to 27; the acceptance speech by the nominee was held on August 28 at Invesco Field at Mile High. Several additional events were held at venues throughout the downtown area and neighboring cities.</div>
      <div>
      	The DNC and the associated events presented the City of Denver with the highest levels of security challenges to ensure the safety of visitors and citizens, and the protection of public infrastructures and private business properties. As a National Special Security Event (NSSE), the United States Secret Service (USSS) served as the Lead Federal Agency (LFA); the Denver Police Department (DPD) was designated as the Local Lead Agency (LLA). The USSS and DPD established 17 DNC planning subcommittees comprised of Federal, state and local agencies that developed and implemented a comprehensive DNC Safety and Security Plan.</div>
      <div>
      	The success of the 2008 DNC was the result of sixteen months of careful planning, training and preparation. This planning process resulted in a seamless, comprehensive operation that ensured the security of the DNC and preservation of public safety. This exceptional effort resulted in the effective and efficient preparation, communication and response during the DNC that enabled lawful protest and protected First Amendment rights while sustaining the protection and safety of all citizens and property.</div>

      	The Zen Fire Service Institute, the State Fire Academy, is charged with providing ODP approved training to the rostered Team members. In an effort to assess the effectiveness of the training, as well as the ability of the Teams to deploy from their local region, ZFSI was again charged by the ZTTF, to develop an annual validation of Teams, to be conducted at the ZFSI training campus in Zen, Zen.</p>
      <p>
      	Zen Fire Service Institute in conjunction with the Mutual Aid System &ldquo;MAS&rdquo;, Technical Rescue Teams Steering Committee. Designed a Full Scale Exercise for a tornado to devastate the training grounds at the Zen Fire Service Institutes Zen campus.</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	The exercise was created to have a natural weather related incident take place in a community that is simulated on the training grounds of the Zen Fire Service Institute Zen campus. This community consists of props to simulate a three story multi-unit apartment building, a concrete and heavy steel office complex, and a medical facility. A tornado has touched down causing extensive damage to the site. The responding Teams were required to report to a remote reception location, where base line medical information was gathered and administrative paperwork completed to include credentialing. They then reported to the exercise site, where they were briefed on the situation, given work assignments and BOO location. The total exercise ran approximately 33 hours with each Team working approximately 26 hours, with 7 hours down time.&nbsp; Prior to the Teams returning to their respective quarters, they were debriefed by both ZFSI and MAS evaluators</p>

      <p>
      	Executive Summary</p>
      <p>
      	The Northern Zen University shootings took place on February 14, 2008, during which a gunman shot multiple people on the campus of Northern Zen University&nbsp;in Tranquil, Zen, killing six and wounding eighteen.</p>
      <p>
      	The incident happened on the campus&#39;s Cole Hall at approximately 3:05 p.m. local time.&nbsp; The school placed the campus on lockdown; students and teachers were advised to head to a secure location, take cover, and avoid the scene and all buildings in the vicinity of the area.&nbsp; Six people died in the incident, including the perpetrator, making it the fourth-deadliest university shooting in United States history.</p>
      <p>
      	A memorial service for the victims of the shootings was scheduled for Sunday, February 24, 2008 at the NZU Convocation Center.&nbsp; NZU police were concerned that with all of the media attention and Wesboro Church directed attention, that the memorial service could be a magnet for a person looking to create a significant event.&nbsp; The university police requested a detail from the SWMDT to provide air monitoring prior to and during the memorial service.&nbsp; Such a detail was comprised of 12 members of the SWMDT Science Element.&nbsp; All members of the detail were employees of various state agencies.&nbsp; ZMERT was deployed to provide medical assistance to the SWMDT and other state assets during the deployment to NZU.</p>
      <p>
      	The following objectives were developed for the NZU deployment.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Objective 1: Notify ZMERT team members of the event; provide deployment instructions; and establish a strike team ready for deployment.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Objective 2: Establish an initial patient care area in the assigned location within NZU, with the capability of rapid deployment to another site.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Objective 3: Establish communications between ZMERT, SWMDT Command, and other responders.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Objective 4: Monitor deployment activity and maintain situational awareness using established resource-tracking systems (Groove, etc.).</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	Objective 5: Demobilize ZMERT equipment and personnel in a safe and controlled manner.</p>
      <p align="left" style="margin-left: .25in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	The purpose of this report is to analyze the deployment results, identify strengths to be maintained and built upon, identify potential areas for further improvement and support development of corrective actions.</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Major Strengths</strong></p>
      <p>
      	The major strengths identified during this exercise are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>
      		Patient care area established within boiler room at NZU and a rapid deployment team was established.</li>
      	<li>
      		ZMERT personnel were briefed on the mission, the ZMERT evacuation site and response procedures developed for this deployment.</li>
      	<li>
      		ZMERT was able to maintain situational awareness using the Groove workspace created for this deployment.</li>
      	<li>
      		All equipment and personnel were demobilized safely.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Primary Areas for Improvement</strong></p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	Throughout the deployment, opportunities for improvement for ZMERT to respond to incidents in the State of Zen were identified.&nbsp; The primary areas for improvement, including recommendations, are as follows:</p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>
      		ZMERT staff and volunteers received incorrect information about the pre-determined staging area and reporting time.</li>
      	<li>
      		There was confusion about which ZMERT teams and equipment were required for the deployment.</li>
      	<li>
      		There was confusion about ZMERT responsibility in relation to dignitaries and civilians attending the memorial service.</li>
      	<li>
      		Communications with SWMDT Command and other responders was not established.&nbsp; 800 MHZ radio (including Starcom21), cell phones, and VHF radios had spotty coverage within the structures at NZU.</li>
      	<li>
      		Attempts to resolve communication issues using an VTEC&rsquo;s radio system were not successful.&nbsp; ZMERT did not have the cables needed for the ICRI box in order to patch frequencies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-left: .5in;">
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      	This deployment experience was successful in addressing the process that ZMERT would follow if deployed in the State of Zen in the event of a mass casualty situation that would require the utilization of an alternate care site.&nbsp;</p>

    - |
      <p>
      	&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">
      	ZMERT assets were pre-deployed to NZU to provide medical support for SWMDT and other state assets as required during the memorial service for the victims of the NZU shootings.&nbsp; ZMERT&rsquo;s medical package and personnel were pre-staged in the boiler room of NZU.&nbsp; ZMERT staff were instructed to wear civilian clothing instead of ZMERT uniforms, to limit the size of the deployment team, and to deploy only with trucks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      	Philip McCormick interviewed Matt Mueller, Accreditation Manager and Ted Witowski, USAI Training and Exercise Coordinator in Mr. Witowski&rsquo;s office. They described the exercise process as a joint venture between the City/County of Denver, the NCR, and the Denver UASI. The City/County local program conducts exercises and training for OEHSM as well as Denver City/County staff as it primarily relates to activities in the EOC, Financial support for many of the exercises is provided by the UASI and NCR as needed. The Program sits as a stakeholder in the UASI and NCR training and exercise development and the UASI sits as a provider of training and coordinating of regional exercises. The UASI and the Program conduct independent and cooperative needs assessments with the Program identifying their exercise needs. The UASI and the NCR sponsors regional exercises that are often directly associated with the hazards identified in their Hazard Mitigation Plan and their needs assessment. The exercise needs of the Program are met through this cooperative effort.</p>

      	The 2007 EOP describes the Programs AAR process to identify, track, and resolve deficiencies identified after actual events, training, and exercises:</p>
      <p>
      	Following the City and County of Denver&rsquo;s response to emergencies and disasters, the Office of Emergency Management will coordinate the preparation of an After-Action Report (AAR) documenting the response and recovery activities, efforts and results. Within ten (10) workdays following the termination of&nbsp;an&nbsp;emergency&nbsp;or&nbsp;disaster incident, each department and agency involved in the response and recovery effort will provide to OEM an AAR outlining the agency&#39;s level of involvement, actions, results, successes and failures.</p>
      <p>
      	OEM will compile all department and agency submittals into a comprehensive AAR that documents a summary of response and recovery efforts, the results, and presents successes and recommendations for improvements. A copy of the AAR will be distributed to City and County executive management team, department and agency managers. The AAR will be serve as a valuable resource in building a database from which OEM can derive lessons learned and identify best practices to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Denver&rsquo;s emergency management preparedness, response and recovery programs.</p>

      	<li>
      		<u>Introduction</u></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      	The State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) activations are managed by the Preparedness Squad within the Recovery Bureau of the Emergency Management Section, New Jersey State Office of Emergency Management (NJOEM).</p>
      <p>
      	A corrective action process has been developed to address lessons learned during SEOC activations.&nbsp; The primary catalyst for the detection of areas for operational and procedural improvement is the After Action Report (AAR) required for all SEOC activations.</p>
      <p>
      	Once procedural or operational deficiencies are noted, an Improvement Plan (IP) is developed by the Preparedness Squad staff to; identify specific procedural elements to be addressed, the assignment of responsibility for procedural update, and assign a target date for completion.&nbsp; An on-going status reporting of this effort will be made at each Management Accountability Conference (MAC) until resolved.</p>
      <p>
      	Important to any successful corrective action process is a training and exercise program focused on specific deficiencies or areas for improvement identified in After Action Reports. Training and exercises provided by qualified individuals is also integrated with procedural development and enhancements. Lessons learned during training and exercises may also be incorporated in procedural updates.</p>
      <p>
      	Finally, a records retention program has been established in the form of a formal filing system for SEOC activation documents.&nbsp; The merger of improvement plans taken with respect to written AARs provides a verifiable historical audit trail of how deficiencies are resolved via lessons learned through targeted training and exercising.&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
      	<li>
      		<u>SEOC Physical Document Filing</u>
      		<ol>
      			<li>
      				Once an SEOC activation commences, the Operations Chief or his designee will prepare filing folders for the following documents:
      				<ol>
      					<li>
      						SEOC Sign-In / Attendance Sheets</li>
      					<li>
      						Incident Action Reports (IAPs)</li>
      					<li>
