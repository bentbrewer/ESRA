Permits that involved a single agency were delayed, and the person designated to receive the permit requests (background information, site plan[s], construction specifications, etc.) was not always available. This resulted in a backlog in approved permits.  Recommendation: Leave the permit process with each respective agency, and place definitive turnaround times with a reporting system with central oversight. Provide Liaisons between permit-issuers and event planners.","2011-04-01 01:43:30.332847","2011-04-07 15:59:53.506185",64

161,"Late Delivery Of Equipment: As with many other resources (See Section 11), some did not allow enough lead time in ordering equipment to ensure timely delivery from manufacturer.  Recommendation: As discussed in more detail in Section 11, communications resources and other equipment must be ordered early enough to ensure early delivery, allowing for receipt, programming, and user training.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.662468","2011-04-07 15:54:47.086043",65
162,"WebEOC Protocols: OEM implemented WebEOC over a six-month period prior to the DNC. With all the other planning activities going on, this proved to be insufficient lead time to fully train all users and develop a level of familiarity with the program. While most users reported finding WebEOC easy to use from a technical standpoint, some users were less clear on the procedural side of what type of information should be entered, how entries should be formatted, etc. Respondents who had attended a WebEOC training class in generally responded more favorably than those who had not.  Recommendation: More detailed written procedures and user guidelines for WebEOC are needed. (This need was identified prior to the DNC, but was not completed prior to activation.) Future program implementations should be given more lead time prior to major events.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.663580","2011-04-07 15:54:47.087470",65
163,"Access To City Intranet: DFD command staff in the field were unable to access the City's intranet. Some of the tools available through the intranet would have made a more complete information and would have been nice resource to use during some decision making process. Some of these tools are traffic cameras, HRB information, staffing for the shift, access to high speed printers and documents stored on the City's server. The computer used by the DFD planning section was setup with a VPN using a Verizon air card. The information transfer was extremely slow was not practical to use.  Recommendation: Setup a minimum of two computers with VPN and high speed internet access. The computers used by Command and Plans need to be modern and need to be able support access to the City Intranet. Command and Plans also need to have access to printers and copiers that can support the work load. Tech Services works with TSS to identify 2 laptops and get access to high speed printers. All necessary software and drivers should be installed and ready for use.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.664606","2011-04-07 15:54:47.088660",65
164,"Communications Problems In Security Room At Invesco Field: Following the move to INVESCO Field, Denver Health EMS command was unable to communicate outside the security room via radio due to significant structural interference. As a result, they had to relocate their operation to an area remote from Fire Department command staff, resulting in an inability to communicate face-to-face. (Fire Department Line Shop personnel were able to effectively overcome the radio interference for the radio system used by the Denver Fire Department.)  Recommendation: Identify a responsible person, group, or agency to address communications issues with Denver Health.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.665618","2011-04-07 15:54:47.089792",65
165,"Video Teleconferencing Was Underutilized: Video teleconferencing was not used extensively during the DNC.  Recommendation: Consider using video teleconferencing when feasible to supplement traditional conference calls especially when a higher level of communications security is needed in comparison to standard bridge conference calls.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.666611","2011-04-07 15:54:47.090923",65
166,"Incompatibility Between Different Information Sharing Systems: Several different information sharing and task management systems were used during the DNC, to include the USSS' Incident Manager, WebEOC, SATool, CEPP's Business EOC, and Computer Assisted Dispatch (CAD). For the most part, each of these tools worked well at what they were designed to do. However, the existence of several different parallel systems was sometimes confusing and duplicative.  Recommendation: It may not be feasible to eliminate or combine some systems, as each tool was designed for different purposes and different groups of users. However, better coordination between the systems would help ensure they are working in concert, rather than in conflict.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.667603","2011-04-07 15:54:47.092108",65
167,"Traffic Camera Controls: Several different command centers had access to the City's traffic camera system. While this was invaluable for all centers, it led to some minor conflicts when different viewers wanted to move or zoom cameras  Recommendation: While some conflicts are probably inevitable with any shared resources, a clear written policy should be developed to negotiate priorities for camera control.","2011-04-01 01:56:55.668583","2011-04-07 15:54:47.093228",65
168,"Responder Feeding: Food and drink was provided free of charge to all responders working all of the DNC venues. The food was prepared and provided by volunteer organizations within the region. There was one distribution point at each of the venues; this distribution point was often several blocks away from the station members were assigned. However, there was some initial confusion as to whether the volunteer organization would be providing two meals per day, or two meals per 12-hour shift. Delivery times were sometimes erratic. Lastly, while the quality of most meals was acceptable, a few meals were less appetizing.  Recommendation: As generous as it was of the volunteer organizations to offer this service for our responders, the City needs to ensure that the quality, quantity, and availability of these meals are clear. Before any contracts are signed, the food size and quality should be sampled. Delivery locations and schedules need to be clearly planned in advance.","2011-04-01 02:01:28.379768","2011-04-07 16:55:41.339910",66
169,"Late Purchase Of Equipment: Due to uncertainties over when and if Federal funding would be approved, the City and County of Denver was initially unprepared to purchase much of the equipment and supplies needed to run an event of this magnitude. By the time Federal funding was awarded, and a funding mechanism was established, order windows were nearly past. The rush of last-minute ordering exceeded the manpower capabilities of some agencies, and also necessitated a scramble to find existing equipment that could be used if the new equipment did not arrive in time. Some equipment didn't arrive until a few days before the event, causing another rush to receive, inventory, and train with the new equipment.  Recommendation: Denver or any other city planning for future events of this magnitude should conduct a survey of existing equipment, and an assessment of what resources would be needed for the event, as soon as possible. The host city must make the commitment to properly fund needed equipment for the event up front; they cannot wait until the Federal Government makes up its mind as to when the funding or reimbursements will be released. Host cities must also take into consideration the normal processing delays associated with strict rules in their purchasing departments, and create exemptions to those rules where possible.","2011-04-01 02:01:28.381241","2011-04-07 16:55:41.341547",66
170,"Receiving And Tracking Of Equipment: A significant amount of work is required to receive, inventory, process, track, and distribute major equipment items. The normal resources of many City agencies were overwhelmed by the last-minute receipt of all this equipment. For example, the DFD Repair Shop was designated as the single receiving point for all Fire equipment. One mechanic was designated as equipment custodian, and wound up doing the bulk of the workload by himself under extreme time pressure.  Recommendation: Designating a single receiving location is a sensible option, and City agencies should designate such a location for all new equipment purchases. However, enough personnel and resources must be made available to that location to ensure the work gets done in time.","2011-04-01 02:01:28.382488","2011-04-07 16:55:41.342783",66
171,"Delivery And Set-Up Of Equipment At The Venue: Due to security concerns some equipment was provided to the area but not set up by General Service's personnel.  Recommendation: Ensure that technical personnel are credentialed to enter the venue(s) if they will be needed to set up equipment. Also consider staging pre-screened containers containing equipment such as generators, microphone and amp system and stage materials that can then be quickly provided to a secured facility.","2011-04-01 02:01:28.383676","2011-04-07 16:55:41.343982",66
172,"   Too Many Different Types Of Credentials: The number and type of different credentials led to some confusion and much redundancy. For example, food inspectors needed a total of five different credentials to do their jobs: a DNC photo ID badge, pre-convention credentials for the Pepsi Center, pre-convention credentials for Invesco Field, convention credentials for the Pepsi Center, and convention credentials for Invesco Field. Additionally, there seemed to be some conflict between the DNCC and USSS on what credentials were required.     Recommendation: The number and type of different credentials should be reduced and kept as simple as possible","2011-04-07 16:41:12.254080","2011-04-07 16:41:12.254080",65
173,"   Security Lines for Credentialed Staff: There was some confusion at different check points about what credentials were required to gain entry.

174,"   USSS Credentials Were Not Issued Far Enough Out: USSS did not issue their credentials until one week before the start of the convention. This did not allow adequate time to correct errors and omissions in those credentials.     Recommendation: All credentials should be issued at least two weeks prior to the start of the event. Many problems could have been resolved well in advance by pre-screening photos and database information to ensure information is accurate and current.","2011-04-07 16:41:12.257371","2011-04-07 16:41:12.257371",65
175,"Vehicle Access: The delay in getting member's vehicles through security proved to be one of the bigger obstacles everyday. Because parking was provided for responders within the security zone, each member had to drive a vehicle inside the security area. Although many responders car pooled, we still had at least 30 vehicles going through security screens at every crew change. With a minimal number of security check points open, the line of vehicles was a couple blocks long. This delay caused several crews to hold over for 30 minutes before a crew change could be made. Much of the difficulty was a result of lack of a sufficient number of parking passes for each Fire Department member working the event and miscommunication of the plan between USSS command staff and USSS members working various security posts.  Recommendation: All members employed or working the convention should park off site and be bussed in. If this is not feasible, the acquisition of a sufficient number parking passes/security credentials is imperative. USSS agents working the posts should be better versed in the operational plan. Finally, the planned operational period or work schedule needs to be extended to include 30 minutes before and after each operational period to effect crew change.","2011-04-07 16:41:12.258537","2011-04-07 16:41:12.258537",65
176,"   EOC Credentialing: Credentialing for EOC staff was not completed in advance of the event, partly due to installation of a new card reader system. This resulted in some delays and confusion issuing credentials to non-City employees, as well as entering cleared City employees into the system database. Additionally, there was some confusion over gaining access to the City and County Building itself, which was closed to the public during the convention.     Recommendation: EOC credentials should be issued to identified staff in advance of the event to minimize the demands for just-in-time credentialing.","2011-04-07 16:41:12.259822","2011-04-07 16:41:12.259822",65
177,"   More Venue-Specific Training Needed: Teams needed more specific training for their specialty assignments in the venues. This especially became apparent when the convention moved to INVESCO Field. Members with no or limited knowledge of the venue had uncertainty about breakout room locations and how well they would react if the worst case scenario occurred. Breakout rooms were small and uncomfortable and had limited or no access later in the week. Specialized equipment was not available for all the members on some specialty teams. The move to INVESCO was announced so late that planning, much less training, was extremely difficult.     Recommendation: Ideally, teams would be established several months prior to the event and the venue would allow several training exercises for the agencies that will be working in the venue. Training needs to be more than a review of standard operating practices and a one hour walk through of the venue. Budgeting for training should be a higher priority. Require that access is always granted to break out areas when needed to check equipment and when performing daily equipment checks. Provide reasonable and comfortable breakout rooms for the firefighters and equipment required by the NSSE and USSS.","2011-04-07 16:50:25.693400","2011-04-07 16:50:25.693400",69
178,"   Lack Of Consistency In Assignments: Members did not always work the same assignment when working multiple shifts at the venue, and specialty companies were not utilized in specialty roles at all times. For example, a Fire Department member was assigned to EMS one day and a De-con Strike Team the next shift at the DNC. If a person was assigned to one discipline for the whole event it would created more stability in the process. When allocating the staffing for these assignments it was decided to be as fair and equitable as possible in the distribution of the considerable amount of overtime. Members were asked to sign up for DNC overtime on a "volunteer" basis only. Specialty team members advocated that fair and equitable should not play a role to specialty assignments.     Recommendation: Every effort was made to equitably distribute overtime hours and pay. This resulted in members getting varied assignments during the week of the convention. After the initial draft assignment roster was released, specialty team Captains were given the opportunity to adjust staffing to make sure team capability was not compromised. During off peak hours some "specialty" assignments were staffed with crews that made up more traditional Engine and Truck Companies due to the decreased threat during late night and early morning hours. Normal operations continued outside the NSSE site with day-to-day specialty companies fully staffed.","2011-04-07 16:50:25.695110","2011-04-07 16:50:25.695110",69
179,"Reassignment Of FLSH Assets: Assigning interior Strike Teams and exterior crews to Fire Prevention and crowd control activities diminished emergency response capability. After day one of the DNC it was clear that crowd control would be a major issue for the week. With the equivalent of 11 response crews dedicated to the security zone some crews were assigned to provide crowd control monitoring and dispersal duties during the heaviest activity on the convention floor.  Recommendation: Early planning scenarios involved this issue and options were discussed at length. It was important in the planning process to prevent "two separate fire departments"; one with the sole responsibility for response and the other for code enforcement. Response capability would be maintained when utilizing response companies for crowd control in extreme situations taking into consideration real time threat assessment factors and never dropping below an initial first alarm assignment within the Security Zone.","2011-04-07 16:50:25.696434","2011-04-07 16:50:25.696434",69
180,"   Distribution Of Written Contingency Plans: While DIA conducted a great deal of in-depth planning, the time frame did not allow them to publish a complete collated binder/book of completed plans.

181,"   DIA Fire Command Staffing: DIA fire command and control personnel were not deployed full time during the affected dates. This could have delayed their ability to build a command structure to address a large event. Additionally, responding command personnel may have experienced access problems due to closed roadways and blocked access routes.     Recommendation: Keep command personnel available on site to better address a large scale event.","2011-04-07 16:50:25.699260","2011-04-07 16:50:25.699260",69
182,"   EOC Vulnerability To Chemical Hazards: The Denver EOC is potentially vulnerable to a chemical release, accidental or deliberate, near the building air intakes. Escape hood equipment is not available for EOC staff. While air intakes were temporarily sealed, in the absence of an air filtration system this is a short-term solution at best.     Recommendation: The EOC needs to be able to quickly secure its air supply in the event of a chemical release. Escape hood or similar equipment needs to be available for all EOC staff. Training, PPE and PPE fit-testing must be included in an overall plan for responding to a CBRNE incident in close proximity to the EOC.","2011-04-07 16:50:25.700661","2011-04-07 16:50:25.700661",69

184,"   Multiple Command And Reporting Centers: Some roving teams were sent out on calls by different command centers, such as the MAD, the MACC, etc. This caused some confusion as to who was their primary reporting authority. Similarly, DFD had multiple Command Officers requesting updates.     Recommendation: The command and reporting authorities for all FLSH assets needs to be clarified so that each team answers to one and only one command center.","2011-04-07 16:50:25.703256","2011-04-07 16:50:25.703256",69
185,"   Additional Fire Department PIOs Needed: A PIO from Denver Fire Department was assigned to the JIC during all shifts. However, a DFD PIO was not always available in the field. While participation in the JIC is critical, it is equally important to have a trained Fire PIO in the field, particularly to respond to requests for media interviews.     Recommendation: During events in which the JIC will be staffed and operational, ensure adequate PIO staffing will also be available in the field. Trained personnel can be obtained from within the Department through voluntary overtime for the shifts allotted. (Replicate the procedure utilized for overtime at the Pepsi Center.) Denver Fire personnel may have to reschedule shifts to parallel that of the lead agency.","2011-04-07 16:54:14.908007","2011-04-07 16:54:14.908007",70

While information was made available to the public on how to get to the venue, the same level of information was not made available on how the public should get away from the venue after the event. While busses were running, schedules and pick-up points were not always clear to the public. This resulted in some confusion and frustrated pedestrians.     Recommendation: Ensure that public information covers not only how to get to the venue, but how to get back from the venue afterwards.","2011-04-07 16:54:14.909666","2011-04-07 16:54:14.909666",70

While there was unfettered access to new social media such as twitter, flickr, youtube, myspace, and facebook for the personnel responding to the convention, no specific strategy was developed to monitor such sites.     Recommendation: If social media is considered to be an important but overlooked source of information, a strategy needs to be developed for monitoring these sources. Consider what additional resources might be needed to effectively monitor social media that may be unfamiliar to PIOs. Those who are technologically savvy and regular users of new social media are likely to be most proficient at conducting effective monitoring of information online","2011-04-07 16:54:14.911135","2011-04-07 16:54:14.911135",70
188,"   Documenting Debris &amp; Graffiti Removal: Although debris and graffiti removal was well handled in general, better tracking and documentation of these missions would have streamlined the City's ability to respond to requests for information during and after the event.

189,"   Early Debris Removal: Most debris removal missions were generated as a result of law enforcement security sweeps immediately prior to or during the event. While this worked well, many of these missions could have been handled well in advance, reducing the demand for resources during the event.     Recommendation: Have solid waste equipment begin removing debris from the public Right Of Way before law enforcement starts sweeping the area.","2011-04-07 16:58:17.802431","2011-04-07 16:58:17.802431",71
190,"   Pedestrian Lighting, Portable Toilets, and Water Stations: Lighting, portable toilets, and drinking water stations were set up outside key venues. However, the number were not sufficient for the event, and their locations were not always were they were most needed.     Recommendation: Pre-determine the routes pedestrians are most likely to use, and concentrate on those areas.","2011-04-07 16:58:17.803895","2011-04-07 16:58:17.803895",71

As valuable as they proved to be, they could've been even more invaluable if they had been integrated into EOC operations and procedures earlier in the planning process, and included in training and exercises.     Recommendation: Integrate private sector partners into planning process as early as possible.

193,"   WebEOC: As discussed in Section 4 above, DOEM implemented WebEOC software to assist with EOC operations as well as information sharing between different command centers. DOEM conducted several training classes, training over 300 users on WebEOC. However, this proved to be only a fraction of the more than 700 people who used WebEOC during the convention. Additionally, changes to the program made on the fly, while helpful, created additional training challenges and were not always fully communicated to users.     Recommendation: DOEM should plan to conduct Just In Time Training on WebEOC (and EOC operations in general) during any activation to ensure that all staff are fully trained. Any changes made to the program during an event must be clearly explained to all users.","2011-04-07 17:07:13.847480","2011-04-07 17:07:13.847480",64

198,"   Security Of National Guard Elements: The National Guard Task Forces are not organized with stand alone security elements; this must either be provided by other National Guard forces or by civilian responders. The City of Denver and State of Colorado did not want uniformed, armed military personnel anywhere near the event. Security was a significant concern for unprotected military personnel operating adjacent to a major ingress and egress thoroughfare for protestors. The NG CER TF coordinated with Denver Police Department for perimeter security. This was then delegated to the Auraria Campus Police Department. Additionally, when concerns arose about a protest march of 4000+ persons, horse mounted officers from other supporting agencies reinforced the NG CER TF operational perimeter. Prior to occupation for the operational period, a barrier was installed around the CER TF perimeter, providing both visual and physical protection.     Recommendation: Do not assume National Guard assets provide their own security. Include detailed security plans in the initial discussions. Try to stage potentially contentious military troops remote from public areas.","2011-04-07 19:03:58.323672","2011-04-07 19:03:58.323672",72
