178,Lack Of Consistency In Assignments: Members did not always work the same assignment when working multiple shifts at the venue- and specialty companies were not utilized in specialty roles at all times. For example- a Fire Department member was assigned to EMS one day and a De-con Strike Team the next shift at the DNC. If a person was assigned to one discipline for the whole event it would created more stability in the process. When allocating the staffing for these assignments it was decided to be as fair and equitable as possible in the distribution of the considerable amount of overtime. Members were asked to sign up for DNC overtime on a "volunteer" basis only. Specialty team members advocated that fair and equitable should not play a role to specialty assignments.     Recommendation: Every effort was made to equitably distribute overtime hours and pay. This resulted in members getting varied assignments during the week of the convention. After the initial draft assignment roster was released- specialty team Captains were given the opportunity to adjust staffing to make sure team capability was not compromised. During off peak hours some "specialty" assignments were staffed with crews that made up more traditional Engine and Truck Companies due to the decreased threat during late night and early morning hours. Normal operations continued outside the NSSE site with day-to-day specialty companies fully staffed.,2011-04-07 16:50:25.695110,2011-04-07 16:50:25.695110,69
179,Reassignment Of FLSH Assets: Assigning interior Strike Teams and exterior crews to Fire Prevention and crowd control activities diminished emergency response capability. After day one of the DNC it was clear that crowd control would be a major issue for the week. With the equivalent of 11 response crews dedicated to the security zone some crews were assigned to provide crowd control monitoring and dispersal duties during the heaviest activity on the convention floor.  Recommendation: Early planning scenarios involved this issue and options were discussed at length. It was important in the planning process to prevent "two separate fire departments"; one with the sole responsibility for response and the other for code enforcement. Response capability would be maintained when utilizing response companies for crowd control in extreme situations taking into consideration real time threat assessment factors and never dropping below an initial first alarm assignment within the Security Zone.,2011-04-07 16:50:25.696434,2011-04-07 16:50:25.696434,69
240,Due to the fact that high ranking Division members and allied agency representatives are participating on calls-  SEOC personnel conducting conference calls must ensure that those meetings are conducted precisely on time.  All members of the Division should be addressed by their rank during conference calls- and personnel should ensure that they familiar with the participants' appropriate rank.	Conference call participants and conference call facilitators should remain cognizant of what is being said (and can be overheard)- and should not rely solely on mute buttons.     	All County EOC- County Coordinator and Deputy Coordinator- contact telephone information should be updated.    	SEOC personnel should ensure that they qualify or "double check" all reported statistical information with the appropriate state agency representative- before releasing information.   Section Bureau Chiefs and Assistants should be added to the list of conference call participants.	The Section's command staff distribution list should be updated to ensure that they receive every situation report and weather statement that is generated out of the SEOC.	SEOC personnel must ensure that the personally contact County Offices of Emergency Management to ascertain or qualify certain information such as resource requests- personnel requests and EOC activations- etc.- and should not rely solely on E-TEAM entries to assume certain activities/actions have taken place.	SEOC personnel should continue to ensure that they properly brief and offer assistance to on-coming SEOC shifts. SEOC Operations Training should be conducted for new Section members and refresher courses for all member(s) who are uncomfortable with their role(s) in EOC Operations.  ROIC Logistical personnel should continue to ensure that the ROIC generators are properly maintained/tested- to avoid power failures.	Personnel should ascertain the status/functionality of all NWS sensors and also determine how  information technology equipment that is not currently linked to generator power- can be linked to an alternate power source.    	Situation Reports should be generated for Level III Activations as well as Level IV Activations to ensure that appropriate emergency management related information is captured and conveyed to appropriate staff.,2011-06-28 19:06:55.920276,2011-06-28 19:06:55.920276,107
